## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are a strongly type list of symbolic names that connect to an underlying numerical type. A good use is for giving options for a value to be set to depending on what choice the user wants. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?

you can change an  Enum's type by declaring what type you want after declaring the enum. So you can force it to only use int or even byte as its primary type. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

I have not. I am thinking about using it to add maybe a spicy option for the recipe they are making. So it would just set the myRecipeSpice to whatever heat level the creator sets it at.
