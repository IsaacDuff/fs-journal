## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, Reference type and Pointer type. A value type stores its value within its own memory spot. It actually contains the data for that value. A reference type doesn't store the data directly, instead it stores the address of where that data is being held. Pointer types do not inherit any data from objects and do not store their own data. Instead they point to a collection of values being held elsewhere. 

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, in, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. I javascript the values types were dictated by what function or variable they were set to. The you really had easy access to text, numbers and lists. With these you have a massive array of different types that values can be set to with a simple word. 

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

With reference types, the data is stored in a random place in memory and is then called on by the the reference. Value types store their data directly in their own memory space instead of in some random place inside memory.
