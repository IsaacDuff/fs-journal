## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a row is a given instance of an object on the table. Information in a column is a specific value about each of those instances. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY_KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL, 
) default charset utf8mb4 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; this will delete a specific thing from the table. 
DROP TABLE table_name; this will clear out the entire table and drop it from the database so it must be recreated. 
```
