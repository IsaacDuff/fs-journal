## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

console.log is the primary way to write information to the console. It is used when you want to test if a function is working. There are also console errors that will write things to the console when your function is wrong or undefined however these are only useful when you are checking the function or something that you added to it. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab gives you a full breakdown of HTML and CSS. It is super helpful with debugging cause you can walk through each step that is being proccessed or even put a stop inside of it to get a better look. It also lets you see the breakdown of how the page is situated and what CSS elements are affecting what. 

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using a debug tag or a return tag to stop your function within the console is a better way to check your code. This will allow you to stop your code at a certain point to check each step as it triggers. Also, using break points to debug you code will help in making sure each step functions instead of having to go through it over and over again.
