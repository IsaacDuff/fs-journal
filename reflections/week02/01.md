## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope is where my variables are available. Such as when it is outside a function it is available for use across the webpage while inside a function makes it unavailable to use outside of that specific function.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting is when variables and functions will move to the top of their respective scopes before the code actually runs. 

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

Var is more useful when I have something I am wanting to apply to the entire workspace. It is globally scoped while the other two are block scoped. 

Let is the better version of var. Its primary difference and use is the fact it can have the same name but as long as the two are inside different scopes then it wont error out. 

Const is used for when you need your variable or array to never be changed from that status.
