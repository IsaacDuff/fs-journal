## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

There is var, let and cont. Var and let are very similar except let is always a better use cause it can be referenced globally. These two can be changed by outside variables and functions while cont will make whatever its values or internal functions are unchangeable.

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

Parameters are the name of the things we are calling within the () of a function. Arguments are the values that are called from within the () when the function is called. 

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is when we use a function as the parameter within another function to call the value or the result of that function. This is essentially having one simple function that creates some sort of value and then putting its name in as the parameter of another function. 

such as: 
function upPets(pets) {
    pets ++
}

function doubleAllPets(upPets) {
    upPets * 2
}
