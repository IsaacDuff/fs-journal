## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

Creating a breakdown or a plan for you application before you code gives you a baseline understanding of how it is supposed to work before you start writing it out. This makes it easier to identify exactly what needs to go where. It also allows others working on the same projects to understand exactly how the website is supposed to look and function. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

If i ever get stuck then I usually go back to my previous work and see if I have solved this problem before. However, once I see that its not something I've worked on before then I start googling because its probably a problem someone else has fixed before. 

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

Doing he same thing over again. I tend to not go google something i don't know. I will sit there and try to get it right over and over instead of going and checking other sources.
