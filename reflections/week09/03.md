## Questions

1. What is a ***Base64 encoded image***?

It is an encoding schema that represents the binary data of an image in a text format. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 encoding?

One is file size. base64 encoding increases your file size by about 25%. Second is your CPU overhead, by encoding like this the browser now has to decode and interpret the image before it can load anything, this adds extra layers of unnecessary work. Third is caching problems. Images coded like this cant be cached locally so they have to be fetched from the server every time which adds extra load to your server and the bandwidth bill. Finally you are hurting your user experience as well cause base64 images are not accessible via a public url. This means users can get links to point back to your website. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Back then websites had heavy limits on the number of connects they could send to the server. Images had to queue up requests and wait "in line" for the others to finish before they would get data returned. Now days with HTTP/2 browsers can send hundreds of files through a single connection so the base64 encoding now just interrupts the process and slows everything down.
