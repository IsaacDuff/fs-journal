## Questions

1. What is a ***Github action*** and how do they work?

github actions are workflows that help offload some of the tooling to github. They allows you to handle alot of common tasks like build, deliveryts and integrations. They are stored in the github/workflows folder and are something you build out kinda similar to a component that will take care of some action while not being directly in your primary folders. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

they allows you to create continuous actions that take care of alot of your common ones so you dont have to do them over and over again. Ex, one that whenever you page changes it will update the github instead of pushing and pulling every time. 

3. What types of ***trigger actions*** can a workflow use? What do they do?

Workflow, Scheduled, Webhooks and External. They manage the triggering of actions.
