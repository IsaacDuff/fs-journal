## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using the standard full stack node.js and vue to create our project. Principles wise we are trying to use consistent naming conventions cause we have a ton of data that each has a separate purpose. We are also using the scrum principles every day such as the scrum meetings to ensure we are all on the same page. We are also making sure to take consistent breaks to ensure our minds stay sharp. 

2. What went well so far?

Our pair programming worked extremly well when we implemented it. We only used it for certain occassions but the two minds on one project for the many to many relationships help emmensly

3. What would you do differently? Why?

focus a bit more on communication. We sometimes had problems cause one person would start working on a page someone else already was in. It caused some merge conflicts here and there.
