## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

its the string or information added to the end of a url so the website can read it and take us to a specific end point or group of data. 

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

a query parameter starts with a ? followed by the key value you are trying to access. If you have more than one then the & is used between them to show the separation. 

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

this will be useful when separating out different portions of our website that can easily be accessed with that string.
