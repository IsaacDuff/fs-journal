## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

They are one to one, one to many and many to many. 

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

embedding relationships are locked in, this is connected to this. With linking we add a link to the other information, this gives us more versatility with out information. 

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

We want to separae all of our different relationships so they dont stack. in the ex on the reading, we for books and categorys, we would want to tag all of our books with their category and not the other way around cause then we would push the limits that the category could hold. Also by using the queries we can access all parts of our relationships from both angels and delete things by one side or the other without breakage.
