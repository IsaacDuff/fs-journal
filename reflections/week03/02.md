## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

encapsulation allows the bundleing and ordering of data that can be acted on by methods that call to the object for a response instead of operation on it directly. In addition this allows you to have private properties that cannot be affected by the user but can be called foward by methods to recall or change data. 

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

Closuers and underscore prefex's are not a strong form of encapsulation. They can be used to make an object private however they tend to break internally when something outside is changed. Another problem is they tend to leak and allow passage to create dpenedencies on data that that should have been private and thus breaks due to the data being different or not even there anymore. A big problem is if the underscore is not meant for your code but it is used because the user doenst know then it can break your code. With encapsulation they dont have access to what you dont give them so they can't break it. 

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

we can state a class with a name that has a specific variable inside. this allows our other functions to acces it but it cannot be directly changed by the user. Our functions and methods can reach out to it but it cannot be directly influenced.
