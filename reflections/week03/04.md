> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

It solves the problem of many components that need the same input from having to have many push or pull methods. instead it allows us to update or push those things based on certain events. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

They are subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast. More specifically the subscribe method, the unsubscribe method and the broadcast method. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

Essentially we are have an large amount of different functions each that can be called upon using proxies. With the observer pattern it goes through and checks what things are allowed we are calling and either adds them or removes them from what is allowed then it runs what is still within that group.
