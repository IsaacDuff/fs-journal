## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the ***handler***?

The two most common are get and set. 

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every `get` to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

You have to make sure you are giving it its two parameters so it can access the value of the object as well instead of just overriding the entire thing with just what the handler has been given, in the readings case, a con.log with a comment. 

3. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?

with a get one i can check that the property being accessed is the one i want to allow to be accessed. otherwise i can throw an error up using that proxy to add my handler to this object. With the set, i can go the other way and instead of letting something be accessed i can make a rule about what can be put within the object.
