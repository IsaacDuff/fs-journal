## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing, component testing and E2E testing. Unit allows us to test each portion of code individually and without anything else touching it. Component testing. this form of testing allows us to check the entire component white it is mounted on the DOM. E2E testing allows us to test the entire application in its final form. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Component based. With component based, if all components are working you will have a higher chance of all the entire application working. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

The end to end. If you do everything then test and get an error then you wont know where your error is. the other two are more important and should be done often.
