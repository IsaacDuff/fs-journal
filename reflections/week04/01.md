> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacadelmy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

One of the main signs of callback hell is a massive function doing multiple things in a basic descending order of operations. Essentially every line needs to go off before the next is read. This causes a massive pyramid looking code that is easily breakable. The primary cause is thinking JS works on a one line to the next basis. In truth, JS works on more of a reference basis. It will work from the top down but things can be called in to start at different times. 

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous means wait, or take your time there will be a break. It uses callbacks to create stops within your code where it will run other things instead of the next line. It makes it so instead of things going off in order, they instead go off when things complete. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

-Keep code shallow: this means by giving your functions specific names you can now keep them organized wherever they are. You can move them around and reference them out of order, and any errors or exceptions will show you exactly which on is wrong based off the name. 

-Modularize: This means to take your basic code apart and turn it into seperate files. The using formUploads you can call those functions and instead of a stack of code you will have a few simple lines. 

-Handle every error: this means to always be fixing your errors as you go. A main way of doing this for your platform errors is to create the first return an error message with an if statement with error so that if your thing errors then you will know.
