## Questions

1. What does ***REST*** stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

it stands for representational state transfer, it means that the server will transfer the state of the called resource. 

2. What does ***stateless*** mean?

it means the server remembers nothing about the user. it doens't remember if things have been called before or what previous responses it has performed. it gets all of its information from the request and keeps none. 

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a ***RESTful API***?

they use an endpoint url, essentially its a step by step process for the api to work down to get to a certain point. by giving the url certain endpoints we can access specific information within that application.
