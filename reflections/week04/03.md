## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `async`/`await`?

async and await are used to force javascript to wait for something to finish before moving on. Javascript will start a process and then continue on while it is still loading so in the instance of an api, it will start grabbing the data then move on to the next thing. This is bad cause we normally want the data we are getting so we can do things with it on the following functions and lines, however it will just move on. With await we can stop it so it will load everything first then move on so our following functions and lines will run properly. 

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

you need to have async in front of the function.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `async`/`await`?

they let us pause our script to ensure certain things load prior to moving on . It makes it easier to debug cause it will be treated like sychronous code and it will be read as such.
