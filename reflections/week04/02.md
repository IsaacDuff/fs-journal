## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

They are Pending, Resolved and Rejected. 

2. How do `Promise`s seek to resolve the issues of 'callback hell'?

Instead of getting a ton of responses with callbacks that all look the same we will catch a specific response. We can chain our functions together and they will come back in their specific order based off of their function run order. With regular call backs we will just get a lump of responses that cant be easily read. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then will only do anything if the promise is resolved. if it fails it wont do anything. catch is used cause it will trigger if the promise fails as well so we can see what happened.
