## Questions

1. What are ***lifecycle hooks***? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

lifecycle hooks are hooks that can be called to get a window into how your components are being used behind the scenes. They create a stop point for you to have access to each step of a components life. 

2. How have you used lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

I haven't used them too much. However I did try to use the created one a bit to try and catch my components as they were intitialized but before they got mounted to the page to try and see if everything was being pulled up correctly. Don't think I did it right. I was probably neeeding to use beforeMount hooks to see it after it was created but before it was sent through. 

3. What are ***mounting hooks***? When might you use them?

Mounting Hooks are used to access your component right before or directly after it is mounted. They are useful for when you are needing to access your component right after it is created but before it affects your DOM or right after it comes in to make additional changes to your DOM.
