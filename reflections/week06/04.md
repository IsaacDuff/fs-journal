## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

a nested route is another route injected into your code that allows you to access another pathway. You could create routes that can be placed at the end of your url to inject in specific lines to get to a specific place. Essentially you can create working links within one page to other pages and those links are contained within that page. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

whenever you are trying to access an endpoint that is holding information that you can pass along. using router link i could create a link directly from my homePage to my active profile page that will inject in the necessary http into the url to get me directly to that page from my homePage

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can, in the previous one i was saying you could create one to go from homePage to profile page. using params you could pass in a different id to open up an entirely different profile page depending on what parameter you passed in.
