## Questions

1. What is ***Component-Based Architecture***?

It is another way to build an application but through the use of many encapsulated individual parts that are independent of one another to build out each piece of an application. 

CBA is another way to create the structure of your application. Unlike MVC where everything is simply split into its jobs, CBA splits things into components. 

2. What are some benefits of Component-Based Architecture?

Components we create are reusable by other parts of the application but have the different copies be independent of one another. This leads into another bonus of CBA which is its rendering. instead of how it was with MVC where an entire component or page would have to be re-rendered, with CBA only the changes to the component will update instead of the whole thing reloading. 


3. What are some drawbacks to Component-Based Architecture?

the single responsibility that CBA pushes can easily lead to cluttered and messy apps. If it is used for your entire application you can easily overdo it and have a mess of code. MVC is super useful for separating out entire sections of an application into a standard view, CBA can throw a wrench into this with its imports and exports between too many components can lead to messy code.
