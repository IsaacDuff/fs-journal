## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A psuedo-class is a selector that targets an element in a specific state. A common one is hover. It makes it so when you hover over a button for example then it will trigger some effect.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a value that rules use to decide which one will apply to something that has multiple rules on it. I can use the specificity of my rules to override one another to give something specific its own css

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

If you use the !important feature too much you could start having issues with multiple items having it on them and then competing for the primary spot to apply their values.
