## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***? 

To provide a clear layout of a websites architecture, information and design .

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

There are low-fidelity, mif-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes. The low one is essentially a simple sketch, just to get the skeleton of the webpage written out. They are useful for showing multiple designs or if you're trying to explain something to someone on the fly. Mid ones are essentially a black and white breakdown of the website and all its components using basic images and objects. A high one is a full breakdown of a website in all its aspects. It is essentially the final design before the codes use it to build the website. 

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I do believe they are useful. Going in blind to a project can cause more problems than not due to there being no structure to whats being built. This gives you the ability to get a final product or at least a version of it so you have an idea of what you're building.
