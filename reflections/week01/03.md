## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

The adding spacing to show when two groups of elements are separate instead of using lines or other objects to show the break.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

The Cheating at Design doc on the site, Pintrest, other sites that have good designs, youtube to watch videos about web design. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

With a badly designed website people wont be willing to actually look through the information you have created cause they will be distracted by the poor design. For example, an online store with a bad design is less likely going to get sales because people will not enjoy the site. You can convey trust in your product and site with good design.
