## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

A primary key is the PRIMARY identifier for an instance of an object on a table. A foreign key is a reference key. It allows you to reference another row in another table from within this table. 

2. What is an ***alias***?

An alias is an SQL way to rename a column, without having to change the table itself. However it will only last for the instance of the CRUD method you are attempting. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
dp.*, d.*, p.*
FROM doctorsPatients dp
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
WHERE dp.doctorId = @doctorId

```
