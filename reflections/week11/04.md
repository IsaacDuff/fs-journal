## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I have learned an insane amount of information in a very small amount of time. I am concerned that on my final project. I wont remember everything i need to remember and have some issues with that. I am going to make sure I don't mess up my time spacing and ask questions in a timely manner using a timer. I enjoyed getting to learn so much about coding and this new career. When I started out I had a really hard time with the jargon of a software developer. I was so used to medical terminology that switching my brain to computer language instead of latin was an interesting hurtle.
