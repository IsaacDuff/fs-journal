## Questions

1. What does ***inheritance*** accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to reuse code from one class to another. 

2. How does ***member inheritance*** work in C#? Does a `Class` inherit all members of the base `Class`?

Member inheritance is the inheritance state of the members within a class. Not all members are inheritable. For instance a constructor will not be inherited by the derived class. 

3. How does ***accessibility*** affect inheritance?

Members and classes who are private become uninheritable. They cannot any longer have derived classes received members from them and private members can no longer be accessed by derived classes.
