## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

It is a type of attack on your application that is done by the attacker injecting SQL into your url to gain control over all or a specific aspect of your website. 

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

By modifying cookies to gain access to data in the back-end when it is stored there. With the simple HTTP sql injection. And then second order ones, which are similar to the HTTP sql injection but are designed to run at a latter point. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Using an Intrustion detection system will allow us to catch these kinds of attacks. In addition, whitelisting certain injections and banning all else will allow us to "lock down" what can be sent in.
